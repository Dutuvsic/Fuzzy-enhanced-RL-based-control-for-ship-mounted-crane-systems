# Fuzzy-enhanced-RL-based-control-for-ship-mounted-crane-systems
Implementing reinforcement learning algorithm iteration for underactuated ship-mounted cranes through MATLAB code

Start by running the shipcraneRL_main.m program

shipcraneRL_main.m        Main program
shipRL.m                 RL algorithm
rarm_shipc.m              Parameter setup 
rarm_mdpstandalone.m      Discrete-time dynamics 

PS: A ship-mounted crane model that can be established through Matlab/Simulink can better demonstrate the control effect.
